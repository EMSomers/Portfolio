                    <p>I was asked to create a high-fidelity wireframe for a group interested in creating an app that
                        would educate users on the traditional medicinal properties of plants. They wanted
                        this
                        space to include three key features:

                            An
                            area where users could learn how to properly harvest flora as well as record notes from
                            their
                            harvest

                    <p>This was an assignment where students were asked to create a logo and business card. We were
                        required to
                        create a large piece of art with a logo that reflected a small detail of that artwork. I created
                        this
                        piece focusing on the Eagle for two main reasons. The Chimmnising community has a strong
                        connection to
                        Eagles and use Eagles to represent the community. Additionally in the Seven Grandfather
                        Teachings the
                        Eagle represents Love. It was very clear in their companies values and mission that Chimmnising
                        Hydroponics has a lot of love for their community I felt this passion needed to be showcased.

                    <h2>Metis Mawkawsins</h2>
                    <p> This was an assignment to create a logo for a small MÃ©tis business that hand-makes custom
                        moccasins. They
                        wanted their logo to honour Moose, as all of their materials are sourced from Canadian hunters.
                        I
                        created this piece so the moccasin shape was clearly recognizable with the heart of it featuring
                        a Moose
                        footprint. As a proud Metis citizen I was happy to collaborate on this piece and be able to
                        incldue my own Metis flower designs.

                        Being able to build my own portfolio has been a dream come true. I began by creating
                        high-fidelity wireframe using Figma and implemented my design choices by building the HTML and
                        CSS in Visual Studio Code. After using a number of different hosting sites over the past fifteen
                        years I am proud to be able to say that my portfolio truly reflects my style. It was a great
                        learning opportunity to understand better practices I can use moving forward, where I excel, and
                        where I have room for improvement.
