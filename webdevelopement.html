                    <h2>Pineapple Island</h2>
                    <p>
                        This was a cumulative assignment I completed with the Indigenous Friends Association. Students
                        were
                        asked to recreate a website based on an image and style guide.
                        I was able to surpass the standard requirements by including a functioning form to submit emails
                        for
                        the
                        website

                        Building the HTML file allowed me to showcase my knowledge and understanding of the skills we
                        learnt
                        over a twelve week period.

                    <p>
                        Creating the CSS file was challenging because I wanted to ensure that everything I made was
                        scaled
                        accurately in relation to the original image. This required a keen eye for detail and
                        understanding of
                        the styling semantics required to achieve the same look.

                        While my design is incredibly basic, I am very proud to say that after my twelve week program
                        with the Indigenous Friends Association I was able to build my own portfolio. This incldues
                        multiple pages that are linked, and open in new windows, a contact button that will directly
                        send you to your email, images on the home page that will directly open the pages where the
                        content exists, as well as an email subscription form and button! I cannot wait to expand on my
                        new skills and help others improve their websites.
