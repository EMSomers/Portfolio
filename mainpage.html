                <p> My Web Development journey starter with the Indigenous Friends Association. I am so proud to be
                    a
                    graduate of this program, where I learnt foundational skills in HTML and CSS. The more I learnt
                    about web development the more I realized that this was the path I was meant to be on.</p>

                <!--  possible iteration of this paragraph<p>
                        I was able to partake in the Indigitech program offered by the Indigenous Friends Association in the spring of 2024. This program gave me foundational skills in HTML and CSS. It was an incredible opportunity that helped me realize I have a passion for web development and would love to continue to build on my skills.

                    <!-- First Draft  <p> I have always been design oriented. In my youth I had several opportunities to build on my
                        design skills using various mediums. This has enabled me to design thoughtful logos and user
                        interfaces. </p> -->
                    <p>
                        I have always had a strong design sense. Through building my own company, Redwood Ranch Designs,
                        and my time with the Indigenous Friends Association I have been able to hone these skills.

                    <p>After years of trying my hand at different mediums I found my true passion lies in relief prints.
                        I love the slow meditative process of carving out a block, rolling the final product with
                        pigment and slowly pressing each image by hand.
